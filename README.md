### User Stories(US)/(TS)Test Scenarios
- **US:**As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that
take place in that city.
- As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
information about an event.
- As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so
that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
- As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I
viewed the last time I was online.
- As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can
open the app faster.
- As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so
that I know what events are organized in which city
